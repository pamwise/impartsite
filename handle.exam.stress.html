        <h1>How to Handle Exam Stress</h1>
        <p>Exams can be overwhelming, but managing stress effectively can help you perform better and maintain your well-being. Here are some practical tips to handle exam stress:</p>

        <h2>1. Plan Ahead</h2>
        <p>Creating a study schedule is key to avoiding last-minute cramming. Allocate specific time slots to each subject or topic, and stick to your plan as much as possible. This helps you stay organized and confident.</p>

        <h2>2. Take Breaks</h2>
        <p>Studying for long hours without breaks can lead to burnout. Follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique" target="_blank">Pomodoro Technique</a>: study for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. This boosts focus and retention.</p>

        <h2>3. Stay Active</h2>
        <p>Physical activity reduces stress and improves concentration. Even a 10-minute walk or stretching exercise can make a big difference. Try to incorporate movement into your daily routine during exam preparation.</p>

        <h2>4. Eat Well</h2>
        <p>A healthy diet fuels your brain. Include foods rich in omega-3s, antioxidants, and vitamins, such as fish, nuts, fruits, and vegetables. Avoid excessive caffeine and sugary snacks.</p>

        <h2>5. Practice Relaxation Techniques</h2>
        <p>Deep breathing, meditation, and yoga can help calm your mind. Spend a few minutes each day practicing mindfulness to reduce anxiety and improve focus.</p>

        <h2>6. Get Enough Sleep</h2>
        <p>Sleep is essential for memory consolidation and cognitive function. Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep every night. Avoid pulling all-nighters, as they can impair your performance the next day.</p>

        <h2>7. Talk About Your Stress</h2>
        <p>Sharing your feelings with a trusted friend, family member, or counselor can help alleviate stress. Don’t hesitate to seek support if you feel overwhelmed.</p>

        <h2>8. Practice Past Questions</h2>
        <p>Working through past exam questions can familiarize you with the format and help you identify areas that need improvement. It also boosts confidence.</p>

        <h2>9. Stay Positive</h2>
        <p>Maintain a positive mindset and avoid comparing yourself to others. Remind yourself of your progress and focus on doing your best.</p>

        <h2>10. Reward Yourself</h2>
        <p>After completing a study session or exam, treat yourself to something you enjoy—a favorite snack, a movie, or time with friends. Rewards keep you motivated.</p>

        <p>Remember, exams are just a part of your journey. Stay calm, take care of yourself, and believe in your abilities. Good luck!</p>
